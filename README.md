# GuiApp
First attempt on working with TKinter.

A program that runs all saved paths with 1 click.

A very basic app that allows the user to add multiple .exe or any other type of file and save them for future use.

The app will save the list with the added files and the user will be able to launch all of the added files with 1 click.
